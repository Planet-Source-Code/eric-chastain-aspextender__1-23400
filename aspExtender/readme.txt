=======================

The aspExtender com components function is similar the the 
<!--#include file="whatever.inc"--> directive in asp, only it 
can be used to include any kind of text from pages outside the
domain of the current page, in the example file "testpage.asp"
i have used the component to include a textfile hypertext menu 
that i have on my personal web space! 
the cool thing is that now there are no boundaries
on what text you can include in your asp pages, include text from
any page on the internet!

questions or comments?
